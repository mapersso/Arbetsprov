Instructions
* Fork the repository
* Create a Feature Branch
* Implement a simple search function according to wireframes and UI (attached on github)
* The search should use a public REST API of your choice using JavaScript
* Search for title, return title (or something like that)
* Display partial search results in a list beneath the search field
* When hitting [ENTER] the selected search value should be saved with date/timestamp beneath the search box (as a search history)
* The page should be responsive, so that if width of window is changed it should adapt
* Nothing needs to be saved if the page is reloaded (i.e don’t have to use cookies/database etc)
 
What we look at
* How’s HTML/CSS/JS written?
* How is it packaged?
* General sanity check on structure and solution
* Is there a readme file giving enough instructions to start your solution?
 
Solve the task as far as you think is necessary. For this specific assignment focus on HTML/CSS, structure and good coding standards rather than advanced JS.
 
When done push your branch and let us know it’s done, e.g. by a pull request.
